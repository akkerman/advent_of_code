#+title: Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation

* Part One

While searching for a way to get the last index of an element in a list, it seems like that is done by first reversing the list. So I quickly decided to build a reversed list. I can get the actual index by subtracting it from the lenght of the list.

However! when determining the next number the rules are:

#+begin_quote
*how many turns apart* the number is from when it was previously spoken
#+end_quote

Which translates as, "the element index from the end of the list", thus in a reversed list, the index from the start...
