* Solve in JavaScript

A straight forward simulation. Loop over the contructions and keep a running tally of
- value of register X
- current cycle
- current strenght

At first I checked the strenght at each 20th cycle, which was wrong. It says `during the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that`. Which is equivalent to `every 40 cycles but start at 20`. ~(20 + cycles) % 40 == 0~

Reading the instructions it seems that an addx behaves ~noop~ first and then adds something to the register.

If we define `check` as
- increase cycle
- update strength when it is time

We can define handling an instruction as
- check
- if addX
  - check
  - increase register

** Part Two


For part two I copied the simulation from part one and modified the check function.

- create a sprite ~[registerX - 1, registerX, registerX + 1]~
- add a ~#~  or ~.~ to a an array if the sprite is visible.

The sprite is visible if ~cycles % 40~ (width of CRT is 40) equals one of the sprites value

After the simulation is done, split the long list of chars into chunks of 40 and print to screen.
