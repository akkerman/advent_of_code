#+title: Day 5: Supply Stacks

* Solve in Javascript

Reading the text I quickly had an idea how I wanted to solve it.
Thing is, I still nedded to parse the text. I couldn't come up with a way to get
it quickly into code so I used some vim macro magic to move and rotate the
stacks to horizontal arrays.

From that moment it is pretty straight forward to code the steps as described.
Then pop all stackt to get the top elements.

** Part Two

My code doesn't actually do the steps as described. It uses a temporary stack
and then puts them reversed on the goal stack.

The alternative would be:

#+begin_src javascript
function partTwo (stack, instructions) {
  for (const [move, from, to] of instructions) {
    stack[to].push(...stack[from].splice(-move))
  }
  return stack.map(s => s.pop()).join('')
}
#+end_src
