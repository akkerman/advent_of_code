* Solve in javascript

3D coordinates Â· 1x1x1 boxes.

*Steps*
1. put all coordinates in a set ~cubes~
2. determine neigbours by moving a cube into each of the 6 directions
3. if a neigbour is NOT one of the ~cubes~ then that side of the cube is exposed

JavaScript not supporting [[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/n-Tuple.html][n-tuples]] natively is a real pita. I have to convert to string *and* keep two records of the same data (~cave~ vs ~lines~ and ~airLabels~ vs ~air~) unless I want to convert back from string again.

** Part two

I am glad I learned [[id:ccd23e17-bc3e-486c-8127-331517a7dc95][Breadth-first search]] (again) last year!

I did start witch approaching this the wrong way. I searched for air within the rock
but that only yielded boxes of 1x1x1 touching rock on all 6 sides. This would
not yield forms like 1x2x1 or stranger stuf like an ~L~ and the like.

In the solution I only used air but the problem stated that the rock went into /water/ and air was trapped inside the rock.
So in order to determine the area of the /outside/ of the rock we need to model the water and figure out where water and rock meet.

*Steps*
1. determine the minimum and maximum points of all rocks \\
   The goal is to use these points (min-1 and max+1) as a bounding box (cube) around the rock
2. Depth first search all /water/. \\
   A neigbour of a water cube is /inside/ the bounding box if it is unequal to rock.
   we need to stop at rock to prevent going /through/ the rock.
3. for all cubes of water figure out how many sides touch rock. \\
   The sum is the /exterior surface area/

** Python version

Port the JavaScript version to Python. Properly use tuples in sets.

Just another titbit that is different and I did not know before:

In stead of writing:

#+begin_src python
if minX <= x and x <= maxX:
  # do something
#+end_src

I can write

#+begin_src python
if minX <= x <= maxX:
  # do something
#+end_src

Which, for some reason, feels more natural to me.
