* Solve in javascript

I love it when a plan just works from the start.
Realisation: for the sand it does NOT matter if it rests on sand or stone so ik kan just treat them the same.

Steps
1. fill a set with the x,y coords of rock
2. simulate falling sand until it cannot go any further (hits a coord that is in the set)
3. place it in the set and increment counter
4. if sand reaches below maxY -> done return number of sand units

** Part Two

Instead of checking if sand reaches a point in a set also check if it reaches the bottom (without actually putting a lot of bottom rock into the set)

as soon as the starting point for the sand is in the set, we're done.
