* Solve in JavaScript

We have to play snake with a length of 2.

Simulating the head movement was quickly written but I had some trouble figuring out how to move the tail.
After some failed attempts with distance I just wrote out each individual situation

- if on the same line, but with a gap, move it closer (left/right)
- if on the same column, but with a gap, move it closer  (up/down)
- if NOT on the same line/column
  - calculate the horizontal difference (left/right · ~lr~)
  - calculate the vertical difference (up/down · ~ud~)
  - if either of them has a distance larger than 1 we need to move
- put the coordinates of the tail into a set to ensure we do not count the same position multiple times

** Part Two

By handling each segment of the rope as if it is a head/tail combination we can move the entire rope.
Generalize the solution of part one for arbitrary length.


* Python

The code for the python version looks slightly smaller because

#+begin_quote python
# I wrote
if tail0 == head0 and tail1 < head1 -1:

# in stead of
if tail[0] == head[0] and tail[1] < head[1] -1:
#+end_quote

Pre-filling an array with something is a lot easier too:

#+begin_quote python
# Python
rope = [(0, 0)] * length
#+end_quote

instead of
#+begin_src javascript
// JavaScript
const rope = Array.from({ length }, () => [0, 0])
#+end_src
