#+title: Day 9: Rope Bridge

* Solve in JavaScript

We have to play snake with a length of 2.

Simulating the head movement was quickly written but I had some trouble figuring out how to move the tail.
After some failed attempts with distance I just wrote out each individual situation

- if on the same line, but with a gap, move it closer (left/right)
- if on the same column, but with a gap, move it closer  (up/down)
- if NOT on the same line/column
  - calculate the horizontal difference (left/right · ~lr~)
  - calculate the vertical difference (up/down · ~ud~)
  - if either of them has a distance larger than 1 we need to move
- put the coordinates of the tail into a set to ensure we do not count the same position multiple times

** Part Two

By handling each segment of the rope as if it is a head/tail combination we can move the entire rope.
Generalize the solution of part one for arbitrary length.
