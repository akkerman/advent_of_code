* Solve in javascript

Pretty straight forward, check if there is overlap by checking the boundaries.

* Haskell

For the haskell version I sort of copy/pasted the javascript version ;-) \\
It looks kinda weird having if/else statements in haskell

* Golang

What a lot of plumbing.
Cannot find a way to destructure the array. Thus I used the variable names from the previous solutions as array indices.

Splitting a text using a pre-compiled regex is pretty nice.
