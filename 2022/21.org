* Solve in JavaScript

I approched this as a kind of a search.
First put each monkey into a dictionary for easy access.
Then, starting with root, do one of two things

1. If the left *and* right side of the operation have numbers, perform the operation and save the result in the monkey
2. for each left/right without a number, put on a queue

** Part Two

By trying out some values it looks like the left component of root decreases when humn increases.
If we assume this is _always_ the case i.e. after some decreases it does not increase again, we can solve this with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm][Binary search algorithm]].
