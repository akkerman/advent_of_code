* Part One
easily done

since I became somewhat facinated with generator functions
that was used in the solution

* Part Two
a few missteps in the thinking process

 1. lets determine all [[id:0791fcdf-440d-4836-8426-cd93bb9a9587][permutations]] of summing 1,2,3 up to 21 minus the current position
    there are countless examples on the internet how to do this
    then lets just use that as a power of 3 (3 possibilities for 1,2,3)
    WRONG: score is NOT calculated based on the dice, but on position

 2. how to play the game for each possible value of the dice
    WRONG: score is determined on 3 dice throws

 3. lets generate all solutions based on the sum of the dice
    GOOD: score is calculated based on next step based on 3 dice throws
    WRONG: universes split on dice throw not on sum so each sum has has 3 throws
    times 3 -> still wrong.. ?

 4. current solution
    realisation struck that there are multiple possible ways to get to the sum of the dice
    this are the possible sums: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    several of them can be received by different throws, e.g. 5:
    1,1,3
    1,2,2
    1,3,1
    etc...

    If the solution requires me to calculate all universes where someone wins
    it will result in an addititional 3*3*3 = 27 possible universes for each existing one

    CAVEAT: these universes exist because the dice created them, not because they are different.
    CAVEAT2: do not count a throw of 1,1,1 as 3 universes, because there is only 1 die
             the first of that universe is also in a throw like 1,2,3 and 1,1,2 and 1,3,1.

    - determine the total of universes after a throw (current universes * combination of dice outcome)
    - pass it along to the next turn
    - if a player wins return the number of universes that he won in
